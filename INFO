INFO


A retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. 
It is more general than a vector store. 
A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them. 
Vector stores can be used as the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well.
